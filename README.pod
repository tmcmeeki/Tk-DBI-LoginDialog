=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Tk::DBI::LoginDialog" is a dialog widget which interacts with the DBI
interface specifically to attempt a connection to a database, and thus
returns a database handle.

This widget allows the user to enter username and password details
into the dialog, and also to select driver, and other driver-specific
details where necessary.

The dialog presents three buttons as follows:

=over 4

=item B<Cancel>: hides the dialog without further processing or interaction.

=item B<Exit>: calls the defined exit routine.  See L<CALLBACKS>.

=item B<Login>: attempt to login via DBI with the credentials supplied.

=back


=cut

=head1 WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS

C<LoginDialog> provides the following specific options:

=over 4

=item B<-mask>

The character or string used to hide (mask) the password.


=cut

=item B<-retry>

The number of times that attempts will be made to login to the database
before giving up.  A default applies.

=back


=cut

=head1 CALLBACKS

C<LoginDialog> provides the following callbacks:

=over 4

=item B<-command>

Per the DialogBox widget, this maps the B<Login> button to the
L<DBI> login routine.


=cut

=item B<-exit>

The sub-routine to call when the B<Exit> button is pressed.
Defaults to B<Tk::exit>.


=cut

=item B<-showcommand>

This callback refreshes items in the dialog as part of the B<Show> method.

=back

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<dbh>

Returns the database handle associated with the current object.


=cut

=item B<driver> [EXPR]

Set or return the B<driver> property.  For specific drivers, the label
associated with the B<dsn> may also change to better match the nomenclature
of the specified database management system.

If a driver is specified which is not currently "available", then this 
method will re-set the driver to the first available.


=cut

=item B<drivers> [LIST]

Returns a list of available drivers.
This defaults to those drivers defined as available by DBI.
Note that it is possible to override this list, however this should be
done with caution, as it could cause DBI errors during the login process.
The most likely use of this method is to constrain the list of drivers
to a subset of those available by default.


=cut

=item B<dsn> [EXPR]

Set or return the B<dsn> property.  In some drivers this refers to the
database name or database instance.


=cut

=item B<error>

Return the latest error message from the DBI framework following an
attempt to connect via the specified driver.
If last connection attempt was successful,
this will return the DBI message "Connected okay."


=cut

=item B<login> [RETRY]

A convenience function to show the login dialog and attempt connection.
The number of attempts is prescribed by the B<RETRY> parameter, which is
optional.
Returns a DBI database handle, subject to the DBI B<connect> method.


=cut

=item B<password> [EXPR]

Set or return the B<password> property.
May not be applicable for all driver types.


=cut

=item B<Show>

The Show method behaves as per the DialogBox widget.

=item B<username> [EXPR]

Set or return the B<username> property.
May not be applicable for all driver types.


=cut

=item B<version> [0|1]

Toggle the display of this widget's version number (module version).
This can only be done programmatically.  
The default behaviour is to hide the version.
Irrespective of the argument passed, this routine will return the 
version number.
